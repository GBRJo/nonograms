### How to Play

Upon starting the game, a timer will begin. Use the left mouse button to fill in cells on the game board. Right-clicking on a cell will mark it with a cross, indicating that you've marked the cell as empty. Once you've filled in the cells according to the rules of the nonogram, a moving picture will appear, and the game will stop, recording your time.

### Development

During the development phase, we utilized a robust stack of technologies including JavaScript for scripting, HTML and CSS for structuring and styling our web content, and Figma, Adobe illustrator, Adobe photoshop for design.
